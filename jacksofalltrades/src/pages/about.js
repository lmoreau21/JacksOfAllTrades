    return <h1>Learning new skills can be a difficult task without the proper resources. Many services out there are overly complicated, time consuming, and may charge hidden fees. Our website, Jack of all Trades, allows users to effectively learn new simple skills with provided instructions and an engaging interface. The site includes 30 possible skills to learn and incorporates a user sign-in that stores various accounts.  As new skills are learned, the user can check off completed skills to show which ones they have learned, and which ones have not been learned. Your goal is to try to learn a new skill everyday and find a new passion alongside that. Skills may include learning how to do pen tricks, tie a tie, juggle, ASL alphabet, morse code, chess, and many more.
    We plan on using Figma to design a website and AWS to host a React application. By using MySQL Databases stored on the cloud, we can easily store and read needed information and take measures to secure it as well. We will be using Atlassian Jira to track the progress of our project and GitHub for code sharing. Lastly, we will use YouTube to embed instructional videos as part of the website with proper credit.
